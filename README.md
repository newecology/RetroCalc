# RetroCalc
An energy audit tool
# What is RetroCalc?
RetroCalc is a MATLAB-based decarbonization modeling tool thats built for existing multifamily buildings. Unlike other energy modeling software, Retrocalc combines energy and water modeling, calibrates results to actual utility bills, and handles partial or full electrification scenarios—all without requiring hours of data entry or advanced simulation expertise. It’s built to deliver ASHRAE Level II-compliant results that are scalable, making it a practical solution for engineers, energy auditors, and program implementers alike.
